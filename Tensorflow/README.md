TensorFlow is Google’s Open Source Machine Learning Framework for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multi-dimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.

TensorFlow has helped a lot of companies built world-class models to solve real problems.
<ul>
  Airbnb: It improves the guest experience by using TensorFlow to classify images and detect objects at scale.

  CocaCola: The advancements in Tensorflow enabled Coco-Cola to finally achieve a long-sought frictionless proof-of-purchase capability.

  GE Healthcare: GE trained a Neural Network using TensorFlow to identify specific anatomy during brain MRIs to help improve speed and reliability.

 Twitter: Twitter used TensorFlow to build their “Ranked Timeline”, allowing users to not miss any tweets even if they follow a thousand other users.
